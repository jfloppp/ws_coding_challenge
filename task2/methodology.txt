The methodology used to classify the tweets was as follows:

1. First, I would fact-check the Tweet by finding several credible news sources
reporting the same thing. I checked to make sure that the dates, pictures, and
content of the Tweet were accurate and factual. Otherwise, it would be deemed as 
misinformation.

2. To determine whether something was news or opinion, I put a lot of emphasis on
the word choice of the Tweeter. For instance, a Tweet that said SCOTUS made the 
"correct" decision and that "Texas is a pro-life state" is an opinion as the Tweeter
cannot speak for all of Texas and there is no objectively correct decision. Too 
much opinion was infused in the Tweet to confidently call it news. Tweets that were
impartial and objective were cited news.

3. A News Tweet was labelled 'Breaking' if it had just happened or was    
currently happening at the time of the Tweet. It was labelled 'Normal' if the 
news was not extremely recent, time-sensitive, or still developing.

4. An Opinion Tweet was categorized as 'Pro-Life' if the content of the Tweet was
supportive of a ban on abortion and argued for it. It was labelled 'Pro-Choice' if
the content of the Tweet was against a ban on abortion and argued against it.
